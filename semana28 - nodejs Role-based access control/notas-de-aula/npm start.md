# `npm start`

This runs a predefined command specified in the "start" property of a package's "scripts" object.

If the "scripts" object does not define a "start" property, npm will run node server.js.


# `npm run`

This runs an arbitrary command from a package's "scripts" object. If no "command" is provided, it will list the available scripts.
