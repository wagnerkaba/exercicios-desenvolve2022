# Responsive Drawer Demo

Responsive Drawer uses the temporary variant to display a drawer for small screens and permanent for a drawer for wider screens.

## Temporary drawer

Temporary navigation drawers can toggle open or closed. Closed by default, the drawer opens temporarily above all other content until a section is selected.

The Drawer can be cancelled by clicking the overlay or pressing the Esc key. It closes when an item is selected, handled by controlling the open prop.

## Permanent drawer
Permanent navigation drawers are always visible and pinned to the left edge, at the same elevation as the content or background. They cannot be closed.

Permanent navigation drawers are the recommended default for desktop.
