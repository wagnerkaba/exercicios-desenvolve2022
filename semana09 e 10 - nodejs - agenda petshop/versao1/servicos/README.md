## What is Faker.js

Faker.js is a Node.js library that allows users to generate massive amounts of fake data for their project use. This can be generated either while running your program locally or remotely by deploying it in a web browser as a webpage. It does this generation by randomly choosing from an online server some of the variables requested for each time it is executed.

It can generate a massive amount of data thereby allowing a developer to push their programs to the limit during testing. Developers can then analyze the data as one would have done in real-life situations and come up with desired decisions.
